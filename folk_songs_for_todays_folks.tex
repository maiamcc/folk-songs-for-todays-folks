% ITCHES IN ME BRITCHES %
\song{Itches In Me Britches}{trad. (after the Poxy Boggards' version)}

I was born of Geordie parents\\
One day when I was young,\\
That's how the Geordie dialect\\
Became my native tongue.\\
That I was a pretty baby\\
Me mother, she would vow;\\
The girls all ran to kiss me then,\\
I wish they'd do it now\\

\chorus{
  Oh, I wish they'd do it now (2x)\\
  I've got itches in me britches\\
  And I wish they'd do it now\\
}

When I was only six months old\\
The girls would handle me;\\
They'd hug me to their bosom\\
And they'd bounce me on their knee;\\
They'd put me in the cradle,\\
And if I made a row,\\
They'd tickle me, they'd cuddle me,\\
I wish they'd do it now\\
\\
At three years old a finer lad\\
There never could be seen;\\
The girls all loved to follow me\\
Right down to the green.\\
They'd make a chain of buttercups,\\
Drop it on me brow,\\
Then they'd roll me in the clover,\\
Well, I wish they'd do it now\\
\\
The East End girls would call on me\\
To swim when it was mild;\\
They'd take me to the river\\
For to splash about a while;\\
They'd throw the water over me,\\
Duck me like a cow,\\
Then they'd rub me nice all over,\\
Well, I wish they'd do it now.\\

% MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB %
\song{Mary Had a Little Lamb}{trad. (Civil War)}
\chorus{
  Hurrah for Mary, hurrah for the Lamb!\\
  Hurrah for the Union boys who did not give a damn!\\
  And everywhere that Mary went the Lamb was sure to go,\\
  Shouting the battle cry of freedom!\\
}

% ONE SPECIES ARE WE %
\song{One Species Are We (The Linnaeus Song)}{lyrics by Benedict Gagliardi, tune is "Awake, Arise Good Christians"}

Of three domains of all life, eukaryotes are we;\\
Inside each cell within us, a nucleus there be.\\
Bacteria, Archaea, unfortunate are they,\\
They have no membrane bound around their strands of DNA.\\
\\
\chorus{
  Linnaeus! Linnaeus! Here’s to your hierarchy,\\
  And let it not betray us! One species are we!\\
}

Come all you motile metazoans and listen to my song:\\
The kingdom Animalia is where we all belong.\\
The plants may have their chlorophyll to photosynthesize,\\
But animals are heterotrophs (and so are the Fungi).\\
\\
Our backbone gives us structure, our backbone gives us strength,\\
So with the other chordates, we find our phylum rank.\\
But let our boney ego never be unfurled,\\
For the spineless worms and insects, they truly rule the world.\\
\\
By the milk our mothers gave us, by the hair upon our skin,\\
It’s clear that we are mammals, class Mammalia we’re in.\\
Most have a placenta, but this class has strange extremes\\
Like the milky-pouched marsupials and egg-laying monotremes.\\
\\
So let’s put things in order, now that we’ve been to class;\\
With monkeys, apes, prosimians, we, the primates, do amass.\\
We all can be distinguished by our well-filled craniums,\\
And the envy of all other life: two fine opposable thumbs\\
\\
Welcome to our family, all Great Apes are we:\\
Orangutan, gorilla and our cousin chimpanzee.\\
But if you believe that monkeys evolved into man,\\
It seems you treat your own brain just like a garbage can.\\
\\
Homo is the genus of the African bipeds\\
Who stood erect, and picked up tools, and learned to use their heads.\\
Our cousins are extinct now, leaving only us,\\
But thanks to our bad habits, we may join them soon enough\\
\\
So we are Homo sapiens, but let us not forget\\
The reason we were given our specific epithet.\\
We earned it for our wisdom, we earned it for our brain;\\
Let fear and hatred never \textit{trump} our consciousness again\\

% TWO MAGICIANS %
\begin{multicols}{2}[
  \song{The Two Magicians (Bide, Lady, Bide)}{trad. (after The Maerlock's version)}
]
The lady sits at her own front door\\
As straight as a willow wand,\\
And by there come a lusty smith\\
With a hammer in his hand.\\
\\
"Well may you dress, you lady fair,\\
All in your robes of red.\\
Before tomorrow at this time\\
I'll have you in my bed."\\

\chorus{
  And he said, "Bide lady, bide,\\
  There's nowhere you can hide.\\
  The husky smith will be your love\\
  And that'll pull down your pride.\\
}

"Away, away, you lusty smith,\\
What you do say is wrong;\\
Do you really think a lass like me\\
can be had for just a song?\\
\\
"I'd rather I was dead and cold\\
And burried 'neath a tree\\
Than a lusty dusty brute like you\\
For to have your way with me!"\\
\textit{And he said...}\\
\\
Then she became a turtle dove\\
And flew up in the air,\\
And he became an old cock pigeon\\
And they flew pair and pair,\\
\textit{Cooing "Bide, lady, bide"...}\\
\\
Then she turned into a bloomin' rose,\\
A rose all in the wood, \\
And he turned into a buzzing bee\\
For to sting her where she stood,\\
\textit{Buzzing...}\\
\\
Then she turned into a swift young mare\\
As dark as the night was black,\\
And he became a golden saddle\\
And clung onto her back,\\
\textit{Neighing...}\\
\\
\textbf{[Insert chase verses ad nauseum]}\\
\\
Then she turned into a sailing ship\\
And aboard of her sprang he;\\
So she turned into a little white duck\\
And he sank under the sea.\\
\\
She left him there for dead below\\
And swam to shore alone,\\
Crying "Fie on you, you lusty smith,\\
This body's still my own!\\
\\
"Though you said 'Bide, lady, bide,'\\
I've no more need to hide,\\
For the lusty smith was ne'er my love,\\
For all his foolish pride."\\
\end{multicols}

% WALTZING WTIH BEARS %
\song{Waltzing With Bears}{lyrics by Dr. Seuss, tune by Eugene Poddany, folk processed by Priscilla Herdman and others}

I went to his room in the middle of the night,\\
Crept to his side and I turned on the light,\\
But to my surprise there was no one in sight,\\
‘Cause my Uncle Walter goes waltzing at night!\\

\chorus{
  He goes wa-wa-wa wa-wa-wa-waltzing with bears.\\
  Raggy bears, shaggy bears, baggy bears too.\\
  And there's nothing on earth Uncle Walter won't do!\\
  So he can go waltzing, go wa-wa-wa-waltzing,\\
  So he can go waltzing, go waltzing with bears.\\
}

We bought Uncle Walter a new suit to wear,\\
But when he came home it was covered with hair,\\
And lately I've noticed there's several new tears!\\
I’m afraid Uncle Walter's been waltzing with bears!\\
\\
We told Uncle Walter that he should be good,\\
And do all the things that we said that he should,\\
But I know that he'd rather be off in the woods!\\
I'm afraid that we’ll lose Uncle Walter for good!\\
\\
We begged and we pleaded “Oh please won’t you stay?”\\
And managed to keep him at home for a day.\\
But the bears all barged in and they took him away!\\
Now he's dancing with pandas and he won’t understand us\\
And the bears all demand at least one dance a day!\\

% A WARNING TO WIZARDS%
\song{A Warning to Wizards}{by Olivia Harding}
A wizard is a helpful chap when one is in a pinch.\\
For those men in their pointed caps solutions are a cinch.\\
They'll lift their wand, their staffs they'll shake\\
When things are getting rocky\\
But lately they've been making mistakes,\\
They're getting pretty cocky.\\

\chorus{
  Don't take out your wand unless someone wants to see it.\\
  Don't stroke your staff unless it's got a job to do.\\
  Keep your wand tucked away unless a lady says okay,\\
  Don't reveal your magic until someone wants you to.\\
}

Gandalf was feeling good, he'd just become "the White".\\
He called the Lady of the Wood for drinks at his one night.\\
Did he press his staff to her thigh\\
And show her his new strength? NO!\\
(Galadriel did not want to spy\\
His tower of Orthanc).\\
\\
Merlin had a crush on the Lady of the Lake;\\
She made his heartbeat start to rush, his legs begin to shake.\\
Did his wand spurt out fairy dust\\
To make her call him "lord"? NO!\\
He calmly offered to clean the rust\\
From her favorite sword.\\
\\
A young man came to Dumbledore, feeling slightly blue.\\
He said, staring at the floor, "I'm into wizards, too"\\
Did Albus take the boy's wand in his hand\\
And show him how it's done? NO!\\
He listened to the (very) young man\\
As if he were a son\\\\

% WHO'S GONNA SHOE %
\song{Who's Gonna Shoe Your Pretty Little Foot?}{trad., fixed by Sophia Donforth \& Emily Steele Hurst}

Who's gonna shoe your pretty little foot,\\
who's gonna glove your hand,\\
who's gonna kiss your red ruby lips,\\
who's gonna be your man?\\
\\
Papa's gonna shoe my pretty little foot,\\
Mama's gonna glove my hand,\\
Sister's gonna kiss my red ruby lips,\\
I don't need no man.\\
\\
I don't need no man (2x)\\
Sister's gonna kiss my red ruby lips,\\
I don't need no man.\\
\\
Who's gonna change the oil in your car,\\
who's gonna kill those bugs,\\
who's gonna walk you home late at night\\
and see you don't get mugged?\\
\\
I'm gonna change the oil in my car,\\
I'm gonna squish those bugs,\\
I'll walk with defiance and I won't be afraid\\
and I bet I won't get mugged.\\
\\
I don't need no man (2x)\\
I'll walk with defiance and I won't be afraid,\\
I don't need no man.\\
\\
Who's gonna fix my meals for me,\\
who's gonna clean my house,\\
who's gonna keep me sweet company,\\
who's gonna be my mouse?\\
\\
You can learn to cook, you can learn to bake,\\
you can clean your own damn house,\\
you can talk yourself through your lonesomeness,\\
I ain't no one's mouse.\\
\\
I ain't no one's mouse (2x)\\
you can talk yourself through your lonesomeness\\
I ain't no one's mouse.\\
\\
I don't need no man (2x)\\
Sister's gonna kiss my red ruby lips,\\
I don't need no man.\\

% THE WIDOW AND THE DEVIL %
\song{The Widow and the Devil}{by Mick Ryan (after The Poozies' version)}

\chorus{
  And the wind blew cold and lonely across that widow’s moore;\\
  She never ever turned away a traveler from her door.
