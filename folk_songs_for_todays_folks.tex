% BOOZIN' %
\song{Boozin', Bloody Well Boozin'}{trad., add'l verses by folk world, Maia McCormick, Becca Mandel}
What do you think I've been doing all day?
\chline{Boozin', bloody well boozin'!}
And how do you think I've been spending my pay?
\chline{Boozin', bloody well boozin'!}
Don't argue the point, 'cause you know I'm not right,
Don't tell me I'm wrong, 'cause you know I can't fight.
And what do you think we'll be doing tonight?
\chline{Why, boozin', bloody well boozin'!}

\chorus{
  Boozin', boozin', just you and I.
  Boozin', boozin', when we are dry.
  Some do it openly, some on the sly,
  But we all are bloody well boozin'!
}

What are the joys of a young married man?
\chline{Boozin', bloody well boozin'!}
What is he doing whenever he can?
\chline{Boozin', bloody well boozin'!}
He goes out a-shopping, makes many a call,
Then he comes home at night and turns on the football;
But what brings him home hanging onto the wall?
\chline{Why, boozin', bloody well boozin'!}

% GHOSTS OF ELLIS ISLAND %
\begin{multicols}{2}[
  \song{The Ghosts of Ellis Island}{by Jan P. Christensen, add'l verses by Nancy Pasley}
]
Oh my name is Juan and I came to this country
On the boatlift from Mariel Bay.
As I walked around the streets of the city,
I heard some people say:
``Oh they all look funny and they don’t speak English,
They’re taking our jobs away,''
Then from out of the past
I heard people who came
To an island in New York Bay...

\chorus{
  Ellis Island!
  Come down the gangplank, go through the door,
  Stand on the long, long line.
  ``Do you have TB or a social disease?
  Do your hands and your legs work fine?
  Do you have some relative there on the shore
  Who can vouch for your sanity?''
  And if you make it through the day
  They'll stamp your card and say:
  ``Welcome to the Land of the Free!''
}

Oh my name is Pat and I come from Killarney,
Where I worked with both my hands,
Then the crops they failed and the agent came,
He threw me off of the land,
So I crossed the ocean with my pack on my back,
And I hope they will let me stay,
Now the Old World is gone,
I can see a new home
From this island in New York Bay...

Oh my name is Rivka and I come from Russia,
Where I never knew luxury,
Then the Cossacks came with their swords and their guns,
They killed all my family,
So I came here where people don’t live in fear,
And I’ll sweat in your dress shops all day;
Though I’m tattered and torn,
I see dreams being born
On this island in New York Bay...

Oh my name is Guido and I come from Palermo,
Where I laid the bricks all day,
But I had a dream that was bigger than Palermo,
And that’s why I sailed away.
Now I’ll build your subways and I’ll climb your buildings,
And I’ll save up all my pay,
So that next year my wife
And my children can come
To this island in New York Bay...

We are the ghosts of old Ellis Island,
We have our tales to tell:
Some left a good life to come over here,
Some left a living hell.
But we crossed the sea and we built this land,
As you will in your very own way,
And to you who have come,
We all say ``Welcome home!''
From this island in New York Bay...

Oh my name is Fatima, I come from Aleppo,
I am a refugee;
For the ISIS came with their guns and bombs,
They killed all my family.
So I made my application and went to all the interviews,
Spent months and years in this way.
Well I did my best to cope,
I tried not to give up hope
I'd reach that airport in Jamaica Bay...

\chorus[New chorus:]{
  John F. Kennedy!
  Come down the gangway, go through the door,
  Where there's always a long long line.
  ``Are you an Islamist or a terrorist?
  Is your ideology fine?
  Do you have any sponsors here in this country
  With financial responsibility?''
  And if you make it through the day,
  Perhaps they'll let you stay
  In the land of the brave and the free.

% ITCHES IN ME BRITCHES %
\song{Itches In Me Britches}{trad. (after the Poxy Boggards' version), add'l verses by Maia McCormick}

I was born of Geordie parents
One day when I was young,
That's how the Geordie dialect
Became my native tongue.
That I was a pretty baby
Me mother, she would vow;
The girls all ran to kiss me then,
I wish they'd do it now

\chorus{
  Oh, I wish they'd do it now (2x)
  I've got itches in me britches
  And I wish they'd do it now
}

When I was only six months old
The girls would handle me;
They'd hug me to their bosom
And they'd bounce me on their knee;
They'd put me in the cradle,
And if I made a row,
They'd tickle me, they'd cuddle me,
I wish they'd do it now

At three years old a finer lad
There never could be seen;
The girls all loved to follow me
Right down to the green.
They'd make a chain of buttercups,
Drop it on me brow,
Then they'd roll me in the clover,
Well, I wish they'd do it now

The East End girls would call on me
To swim when it was mild;
They'd take me to the river
For to splash about a while;
They'd throw the water over me,
Duck me like a cow,
Then they'd rub me nice all over,
Well, I wish they'd do it now.

% MAID OF AMSTERDAM%
\song{Maid of Amsterdam (A-Rovin')}{trad. sea shanty, new version learned from Heather A. Wood}
In Amsterdam there lived a maid,
\chline{Mark well what I do say!}
In Amsterdam there lived a maid
And she was mistress of her trade.
\chline{I'll go no more a-rovin' with you, fair maid!}

\chorus{
  A-rovin', a-rovin', since rovin's been my ru-i-in,
  I'll go no more a-rovin' with you, fair maid!
}

% MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB %
\song{Mary Had a Little Lamb}{trad. (Civil War)}
\chorus{
  Hurrah for Mary, hurrah for the Lamb!
  Hurrah for the Union boys who did not give a damn!
  And everywhere that Mary went the Lamb was sure to go,
  Shouting the battle cry of freedom!
}

% MY THING IS MY OWN %
\song{My Thing Is My Own}{by Thomas d'Urfey (18th cen.), add'l verses by The Angels: Heroines in Disguise \& Maia McCormick}

I, a tender young maid, have been courted by many
Of all sorts and trades as ever were any.
They flirted and wheedled and all had their say,
But my choice is my own at the end of the day.

\chorus{
  My thing is my own and I'll keep it so still,
  For every young lassie should do what she will;
  My thing is my own and I'll keep it so still,
  For every young lassie should do what she will.
}

A sweet scented Courtier did give me a kiss,
And promis'd me mountains if I would be his,
But I'd not believe him, for it is too true,
Some courtiers do promise much more than they do.

A Master of Musick came with intent
To give me a lesson on my instrument.
I thanked him for nothing and bid him be gone,
For my little fiddle he will never play on.

A blacksmith came courting, forge fires alight--
If the iron is hot, he knows just when to strike. 
Alas he did catch me in a moment too cool,
So I would not help him by quenching his tool.

A pirate made bold in his enterprise,
He presented a ship of considerable size:
His vessel was trim, with rigging held fast,
But I soundly refused to climb his top mast 

A dashing young poet came up from the strand,
Seeking a muse with a quill in his hand.
He began to declaim in a manner most gallant:
His verses were fine, but his tongue had no talent 

Until one day I tried with the maid from next door,
Her touch like no man's touch had e'er felt before.
My answer to her as she lifted my dress,
Unlike to the others, was resoundingly ``Yes!''


% ONE SPECIES ARE WE %
\song{One Species Are We (The Linnaeus Song)}{lyrics by Benedict Gagliardi, tune is ``Awake, Arise Good Christians''}

Of three domains of all life, eukaryotes are we;
Inside each cell within us, a nucleus there be.
Bacteria, Archaea, unfortunate are they,
They have no membrane bound around their strands of DNA.

\chorus{
  Linnaeus! Linnaeus! Here’s to your hierarchy,
  And let it not betray us! One species are we!
}

Come all you motile metazoans and listen to my song:
The kingdom Animalia is where we all belong.
The plants may have their chlorophyll to photosynthesize,
But animals are heterotrophs (and so are the Fungi).

Our backbone gives us structure, our backbone gives us strength,
So with the other chordates, we find our phylum rank.
But let our boney ego never be unfurled,
For the spineless worms and insects, they truly rule the world.

By the milk our mothers gave us, by the hair upon our skin,
It’s clear that we are mammals, class Mammalia we’re in.
Most have a placenta, but this class has strange extremes
Like the milky-pouched marsupials and egg-laying monotremes.

So let’s put things in order, now that we’ve been to class;
With monkeys, apes, prosimians, we, the primates, do amass.
We all can be distinguished by our well-filled craniums,
And the envy of all other life: two fine opposable thumbs

Welcome to our family, all Great Apes are we:
Orangutan, gorilla and our cousin chimpanzee.
But if you believe that monkeys evolved into man,
It seems you treat your own brain just like a garbage can.

Homo is the genus of the African bipeds
Who stood erect, and picked up tools, and learned to use their heads.
Our cousins are extinct now, leaving only us,
But thanks to our bad habits, we may join them soon enough

So we are Homo sapiens, but let us not forget
The reason we were given our specific epithet.
We earned it for our wisdom, we earned it for our brain;
Let fear and hatred never \textit{trump} our consciousness again

% TWO MAGICIANS %
\begin{multicols}{2}[
  \song{The Two Magicians (Bide, Lady, Bide)}{trad. (after The Maerlock's version, ed. McCormick)}
]

\textit{CW: stalking, attempted rape}

The lady sits at her own front door
As straight as a willow wand,
When by her came a lusty smith
With a hammer in his hand.

``Well may sit, you lady fair,
There in your robes of red.
But come tomorrow at this time
I'll have you in my bed.''

\chorus{
  And he said, ``Bide lady, bide,
  There's nowhere you can hide,
  For the lusty smith will be your love
  And he will lay your pride.''
}

``Away, away, you lusty smith,
What you do say is wrong;
Do you really think a lass like me
can be had for just a song?

``I'd rather I was dead and cold
And burried 'neath a tree
Than a lusty dusty brute like you
For to have your way with me!''
\textit{And he said...}

Then she became a turtle dove
And flew up in the air,
And he became an old cock pigeon
And they flew pair and pair,
\textit{Cooing ``Bide, lady, bide''...}

Then she turned into a bloomin' rose,
A rose all in the wood, 
And he turned into a buzzing bee
For to sting her where she stood,
\textit{Buzzing...}

Then she turned into a swift young mare
As dark as the night was black,
And he became a golden saddle
And clung onto her back,
\textit{Neighing...}

\textbf{[Insert chase verses ad nauseum]}

Then she turned into a sailing ship
And aboard of her sprang he;
So she turned into a little white duck
And he sank under the sea.

She left him there for dead below
And swam to shore alone,
Crying ``Fie on you, you lusty smith,
This body's still my own!

``Though you said 'Bide, lady, bide,'
I've no more need to hide,
For the lusty smith was ne'er my love,
For all his foolish pride.''
\end{multicols}

% WALTZING WTIH BEARS %
\song{Waltzing With Bears}{lyrics by Dr. Seuss, tune by Eugene Poddany, folk processed by Priscilla Herdman and others}

I went to his room in the middle of the night,
Crept to his side and I turned on the light,
But to my surprise there was no one in sight,
‘Cause my Uncle Walter goes waltzing at night!

\chorus{
  He goes wa-wa-wa wa-wa-wa-waltzing with bears.
  Raggy bears, shaggy bears, baggy bears too.
  And there's nothing on earth Uncle Walter won't do!
  So he can go waltzing, go wa-wa-wa-waltzing,
  So he can go waltzing, go waltzing with bears.
}

We bought Uncle Walter a new suit to wear,
But when he came home it was covered with hair,
And lately I've noticed there's several new tears!
I’m afraid Uncle Walter's been waltzing with bears!

We told Uncle Walter that he should be good,
And do all the things that we said that he should,
But I know that he'd rather be off in the woods!
I'm afraid that we’ll lose Uncle Walter for good!

We begged and we pleaded “Oh please won’t you stay?”
And managed to keep him at home for a day.
But the bears all barged in and they took him away!
Now he's dancing with pandas and he won’t understand us
And the bears all demand at least one dance a day!

% A WARNING TO WIZARDS%
\song{A Warning to Wizards}{by Olivia Harding}
A wizard is a helpful chap when one is in a pinch.
For those men in their pointed caps solutions are a cinch.
They'll lift their wand, their staffs they'll shake
When things are getting rocky
But lately they've been making mistakes,
They're getting pretty cocky.

\chorus{
  Don't take out your wand unless someone wants to see it.
  Don't stroke your staff unless it's got a job to do.
  Keep your wand tucked away unless a lady says okay,
  Don't reveal your magic until someone wants you to.
}

Gandalf was feeling good, he'd just become ``the White''.
He called the Lady of the Wood for drinks at his one night.
Did he press his staff to her thigh
And show her his new strength? NO!
(Galadriel did not want to spy
His tower of Orthanc).

Merlin had a crush on the Lady of the Lake;
She made his heartbeat start to rush, his legs begin to shake.
Did his wand spurt out fairy dust
To make her call him ``Lord''? NO!
He calmly offered to clean the rust
From her favorite sword.

A young man came to Dumbledore, feeling slightly blue.
He said, staring at the floor, ``I'm into wizards, too.''
Did Albus take the boy's wand in his hand
And show him how it's done? NO!
He listened to the (very) young man
As if he were a son.

\chorus[Chorus (with ``person'' instead of ``lady'')]{}

% WHO'S GONNA SHOE %
\song{Who's Gonna Shoe Your Pretty Little Foot?}{trad., fixed by Sophia Donforth \& Emily Steele Hurst}

Who's gonna shoe your pretty little foot,
who's gonna glove your hand,
who's gonna kiss your red ruby lips,
who's gonna be your man?

Papa's gonna shoe my pretty little foot,
Mama's gonna glove my hand,
Sister's gonna kiss my red ruby lips,
I don't need no man.

I don't need no man (2x)
Sister's gonna kiss my red ruby lips,
I don't need no man.

Who's gonna change the oil in your car,
who's gonna kill those bugs,
who's gonna walk you home late at night
and see you don't get mugged?

I'm gonna change the oil in my car,
I'm gonna squish those bugs,
I'll walk with defiance and I won't be afraid
and I bet I won't get mugged.

I don't need no man (2x)
I'll walk with defiance and I won't be afraid,
I don't need no man.

Who's gonna fix my meals for me,
who's gonna clean my house,
who's gonna keep me sweet company,
who's gonna be my mouse?

You can learn to cook, you can learn to bake,
you can clean your own damn house,
you can talk yourself through your lonesomeness,
I ain't no one's mouse.

I ain't no one's mouse (2x)
you can talk yourself through your lonesomeness
I ain't no one's mouse.

I don't need no man (2x)
Sister's gonna kiss my red ruby lips,
I don't need no man.

  She never ever turned away a traveler from her door.
